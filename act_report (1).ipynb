The modal rating numerator value is 12, the median value is 11, while the mean rating_numerator value is 19.91. The rating numerator distribution is right skewed.  \n",

    "* The [boxplot.png](https://viewf6b31853.udacity-student-workspaces.com/view/Images/boxplot.png) shows that the favourite_count grouped by the rating_numerator values. While considering only the integer values ranging from 10 to 14, the rating_numerator of 14 has the maximum favourite_count and the highest median favourite_count followed by 13, 12, 11 and then 10. Also, from the boxplots, the higher the rating, the greater the favourite_counts if the numerator values considered are between 10 and 14. This shows a kind of positive correlation between the rating numerator values between 10 and 14 and the favourite_count values \n",
